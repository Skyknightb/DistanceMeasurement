# Distance Measurement
Distance measurement using Arduino and an ultrasonic sensor.

## Materials:

* Arduino Uno R3
* Ultrasonic sensor (model HC-SR04)
* Jumper wires (4pc)
* Breadboard

## Circuit connections

HC-SR04 | Arduino
------------ | -------------
VCC | +5V
GND | GND
TRIG | Digital Pin 2
ECHO | Digital Pin 4

Original code for Ping example was created by **_David A. Mellis_**. Adapted for HC-SR04 by **_Tautvidas Sipavicius_**. This example code is in the public domain.
